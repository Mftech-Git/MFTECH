                  <p>
                    My journey in IT took a significant turn in December 2021 when I decided to expand my expertise. Investing in a new homelab setup, I equipped myself with a Supermicro server, multiple IBM rack-mount servers, and a complete UniFi network infrastructure. This hands-on experience was crucial, providing a solid foundation for the complex projects I would later undertake.

                  <p>
                    On July 28th, 2023, I made the difficult decision to depart from Old Pueblo Community Services. My passion has always been deeply rooted in Systems Administration and Engineering, and I found that while leadership roles offered invaluable experience, my heart yearned for the hands-on technical challenges and innovation these fields offer. The pursuit for a role that truly resonates with my aspirations led me back to the Managed Service Provider (MSP) arena as a Network Support Engineer. Yet, my journey doesn't end here; I'm on the lookout for my "forever job" â€“ a place where I can fully utilize my skills, continue to grow, and contribute to meaningful projects. The search for a role that feels like home continues, and I'm eager to see where this path leads.
