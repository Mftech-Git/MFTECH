              Improving utilization and response time by automating PC imaging with PXE booting through Smartdeploy on WDS
            </h3>
            <p>
              My 'WDS with SmartDeploy' project dramatically streamlined the computer imaging and deployment process. By ingeniously integrating Windows Deployment Services with Smart Deploy, we not only slashed setup times from over two hours to under 20 minutes but also empowered the team with a scalable, efficient, and standardized imaging solution.

            <p>
              Tasked by the CEO and executive leadership, I embarked on a project to transition the company's file management system to SharePoint. Recognizing a general lack of understanding of SharePoint's capabilities within the leadership team, I initiated a series of educational presentations, ranging from PowerPoint slides to demo videos, to elucidate the concept and functionality of SharePoint.

              </strong>
            </p>
            Efficiency Enhancement: Achieve a substantial reduction in computer setup times, from over two hours to approximately 20 minutes, thereby addressing a significant bottleneck in productivity. Standardization and Scalability: Deploy a unified, scalable imaging process leveraging WDS and Smart Deploy, designed to adapt seamlessly to future technological advancements and organizational growth. Capacity Building: Elevate the team's technical capabilities through targeted training materials on the imaging process, fostering a culture of technical excellence and self-sufficiency.

            </p>
            The project navigated several challenges, notably the team's initial technical knowledge gap and the inefficiencies of conventional imaging methods. A sophisticated approach was required to avoid SID duplication errors inherent in direct cloning processes. By adopting the sysprep tool for image preparation and embracing nested virtualization capabilities within Hyper-V, we streamlined the imaging process, ensuring error-free, reliable deployments. Smart Deploy's integration enabled us to refine our approach to task sequencing and application packaging, markedly increasing the efficiency and reliability of deployments.

            <p>
              I established a robust server environment on Windows Server 22 and utilized Hyper-V to create a master virtual machine loaded with the latest Windows 10 image. This VM was meticulously configured in audit mode, with a curated selection of essential applications installed to create a lean, fully functional image. Key to this phase was the strategic use of Smart Deploy for crafting a custom task sequence that included vital applications, particularly handling antivirus software in a manner that avoided pre-configuration conflicts.

              PXE Booting: Implemented to enable seamless, network-based deployment of images, significantly reducing manual setup time. Audit Mode Customization: Utilized Windows 10's audit mode to pre-install necessary applications without triggering SID issues, ensuring a smooth transition to the OOBE for end-users. Strategic Application Packaging: Carefully selected and packaged applications to include in the deployment image, excluding those likely to cause conflicts or require unique system identifiers, thereby streamlining the deployment process and minimizing potential points of failure.
